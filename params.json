So if you are running a test site locally on your laptop that other computers cannot access, this step will fail.\r\n  * Login or go to your Mandrill account at https://mandrillapp.com/login/\r\n  * Click on Settings (ie the Gear icon on the top-right) >> Webhooks\r\n  * Click on +Add a Webhook\r\n  * Click to enable all entries _except_ Message Is Sent, including\r\n    * Message Is Soft-bounced\r\n    * Message Is Clicked\r\n    * Message Recipient Unsubscribe\r\n    * Message Is Bounced\r\n    * Message Is Opened\r\n    * Message Is Marked As Spam\r\n    * Message Is Rejected\r\n  * In Post to URL, enter the resource URL that you saved in the previous step above. For example: http://yourorg.org/civicrm/ajax/mte/callback?mandrillSecret=108d3af8a77fc502 \r\n* Test by doing an action in CiviCRM that sends out a non-bulk email.\r\n* This should not be necessary, but if you would like to change the secret code that is used to ensure secure communication from Mandrill to your instance of CiviCRM, you can change the secret as follows:\r\n  * Go to Administer > System Settings > Option Groups.\r\n  * Beside Mandrill Secret, click on Options.\r\n  * Click edit beside Secret Code.\r\n  * Change the value, then click Save.\r\n  * Navigate to Administer >> System Settings >> Mandrill Smtp Settings, click on SMTP, copy the value of Mandrill Post URL. Note that this step is necessary since it also activates the use of this callback URL.\r\n  * Use that new value to configure the Post to URL value of the webhook for Mandrill.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
